## Hi there 👋
I am a researcher and engineer passionate about applying AI to healthcare, bioinformatics, and scientific discovery. I see patterns everywhere ♾️—whether in biological data, images, or natural language—and I love turning them into insights using machine learning. My curiosity drives me to explore both the theoretical depth of algorithms and their real-world applications in health and science.

🔬 Research Experience:

  Retinal vessel segmentation for diabetic retinopathy using deep learning (U-Net, preprocessing pipelines).
  
  Odia handwritten numeral recognition with CNNs, contributing to OCR for low-resource languages.
  
  Projects in generative AI and music sequence modeling (Beethoven-style compositions).

📚 Currently Exploring:

  Large Language Models (LLMs) for bioinformatics and molecular biology, e.g., genetic variant interpretation, drug discovery.
  
  Reinforcement Learning and generative models in Computer Vision and Healthcare.

🤝 Looking to Collaborate On:

  Research projects combining machine learning with biomedical or biomolecular data.

  AI for healthcare, genomics, and scientific applications.

💻 Industry Background:

  Worked as a Backend Engineer at Open Financial Technologies, where I gained experience in designing scalable systems and reliable data pipelines—skills I now bring into managing   and processing large-scale scientific datasets.
